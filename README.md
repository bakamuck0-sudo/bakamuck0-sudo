### Hi there, I'm Dmytro 👋

I'm a self-taught Backend Developer with a passion for building complex, asynchronous systems. I thrive on debugging "impossible" problems and building my development environment (Arch + Hyprland + Neovim) from the ground up.

### 🚀 My "Proof-of-Work" (Pinned Projects)

1.  **[Analyzer (Asynchronous SEO Analyzer)](https://github.com/bakamuck0-sudo/laravel_analyzer)**
    * **What it is:** A web app that analyzes a URL (for `<h1>`, `meta_description`) without blocking the UI.
    * **What I learned:** This project was a deep dive into **Laravel Queues & Jobs**. I debugged the entire "pipeline" — from `FAIL` states and `NULL` returns to fixing SSL issues, User-Agent blocks, and the `$fillable` Mass Assignment protection.

2.  **[Task Manager](https://github.com/bakamuck0-sudo/job_app)**
    * **What it is:** A full CRUD application for managing projects and tasks.
    * **What I learned:** Implemented authorization using **Laravel Policies** (`$this->authorize()`) to ensure users can only edit or delete their *own* projects, fixing a critical security vulnerability.
